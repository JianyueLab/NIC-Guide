# How to find your merits and demerits

Usually, you would get a notification if you ever get a merit or demerit point. Sometimes teachers do not give out notifications. In that case you can check all of your merit and demerit points by clicking on your profile icon on the top right corner.

After clicking on “Manage Your Profile”, click on the “Behaviour and Discipline” button. It’s the second one to the left. 

Now you can see all of your merit and demerit points.
